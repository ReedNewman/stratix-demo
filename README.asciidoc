=== Introduction
Hello Reed, I must say that I am very impressed. So I decided to see if I could take it one step further and provide you with the core infrastructure concepts and see how you do (for fun of course). And I've included a mistake or two for your pleasure.

I've no particular goals in mind, just want to see if maybe you can do something trivially simple using the framework that relies on Kotlin idioms in a more puristic manner.
